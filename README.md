External IP Address and Domain are also displayed in the titlebar after initiating a scan<br>

Double-clicking a listed item will give you a popup showing available connection options to that device.  Clickable buttons will appear for available options. <br>

**If you wish to clear your cached list of network peers (ARP Cache) prior to scanning the network, hold the \[CTRL\] key while clicking the Scan button<br>**
**(Note: Clearing network peer cache requires Admin rights, while normal scanning/usage does not. A UAC prompt will be produced for this action if needed.)**
